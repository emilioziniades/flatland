## Demo

[Here](https://flatland.gq) is a working live demo.

For testing purposes, earlier versions of Flatland will be deployed to the Ropsten Test Network. To use the app, you'll need a [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet and some test Ether from a [faucet](https://faucet.ropsten.be/). Yay, free money!

## Local development

If you want to run a local version of this app on your computer, follow the steps below.

First, clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/emilioziniades/flatland`

Change to the `flatland` directory and install the dependencies in `/flatland/` and `/flatland/app`

`cd flatland && npm install`

`cd app && npm install`

Remain in the `app` directory, and start the local development server

`gatsby develop`

Now, you should be able to visit `https://localhost:8000` in your browser and see a local instance of Flatland. Gatsby features hot reloading, so you can just make changes in the flatland/app/ directory and view the changes live.
