## Demo

[Here](https://flatland.gq) is a working live demo.

For testing purposes, earlier versions of Flatland will be deployed to the Ropsten Test Network. To use the app, you'll need a [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) wallet and some test Ether from a [faucet](https://faucet.ropsten.be/). Yay, free money!
